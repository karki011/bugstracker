# Adapters

**Adapters** are required for select sites. Currently dotCMS requires an adapter. The adapters allow for connection to the siteâ€™s database. It points the taxis to the database and gives some defaults to the database to properly connect and sync data to or from the DB. 

There are two adapter types:

1. Read adapter
2. Write adapter

The read adapter is used to get data from the DB, while the write adapter is used to sync data to the DB.
