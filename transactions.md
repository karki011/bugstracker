# Transactions

**Transactions** are used to track a sync while it is in progress. A transaction will track what job is running, what the source and destination are, start and end time, and details as it progresses through the sync process.   
  
The details show where the sync currently is. If itâ€™s looking for the job, or moving data from the source, or close to finishing by moving data to the destination. All that information is found in the transactions.
